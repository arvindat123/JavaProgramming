When discussing **failure and retry mechanisms** in system design or architecture, the goal is to identify how the system handles unexpected issues and ensures reliability and fault tolerance. Here are **key questions** you can ask to understand and validate the system's approach to failures and retries:

---

### **1. Failure Handling Mechanisms**
- How does the system detect failures in its components (e.g., network failures, timeouts, crashes)?  
- What are the common failure scenarios anticipated in this design (e.g., system crashes, partial failures, database downtime)?  
- What happens when a service call or request fails?  
- How does the system differentiate between **transient failures** and **permanent failures**?  
- What is the strategy for isolating failed components or degraded services (e.g., circuit breaker)?  
- How are **partial failures** handled (e.g., a few components in a distributed system fail)?  
- What happens if a critical dependency or third-party service becomes unavailable?  
- How does the system prevent cascading failures across services?  

---

### **2. Retry Mechanisms**
- How does the system handle retries when a failure is detected?  
- What are the retry policies in place (e.g., fixed interval, exponential backoff, jitter)?  
- Is there a maximum retry limit to avoid overwhelming the system?  
- What happens when retries exceed their threshold?  
- How does the system ensure retries do not cause **duplicate requests** or **data inconsistency**?  
- Are retries **idempotent** (ensuring the same operation produces the same result if repeated)?  
- How does the system distinguish between a failed operation and a delayed response?  
- What are the timeout settings for retries at different levels (e.g., service, database, external APIs)?  
- How are retries logged and monitored?  

---

### **3. Circuit Breaker Pattern**
- Is a **circuit breaker** implemented to prevent excessive retries and further failures?  
- What are the thresholds for **opening** the circuit (e.g., failure rate, response time)?  
- How long does the circuit breaker remain open before attempting recovery?  
- How does the system handle requests when the circuit breaker is in an open state?  
- What is the fallback strategy when the circuit breaker is open?  

---

### **4. Idempotency and Duplicate Handling**
- Are all retryable operations **idempotent** to avoid duplication issues?  
- How is idempotency ensured in the system design (e.g., idempotency tokens, unique identifiers)?  
- How does the system detect and discard duplicate requests or operations?  
- What happens if an operation is executed more than once due to retries?  

---

### **5. Data Consistency During Failures**
- How is data integrity maintained if a failure occurs during a transaction?  
- How does the system handle partial updates to data during failures?  
- Are retries guaranteed to preserve **eventual consistency** or strong consistency?  
- How does the system ensure no data loss in case of failures?  

---

### **6. Monitoring and Alerting for Failures**
- How are failures and retry attempts monitored and logged?  
- Are there alerts set up for repeated failures or an increase in retry rates?  
- What tools or dashboards are used to observe retry behavior and detect anomalies?  
- Is there a mechanism for automatically escalating unresolved failures?  

---

### **7. Failover and Redundancy**

- What is the failover strategy (e.g., active-active, active-passive replication)?  
- Are there backup or redundant systems in place to handle service or component failures?  
- How is the switch to a redundant system triggered, and how is consistency ensured?  
- How is failover tested for reliability?  

---

### **8. Timeout and Backoff Policies**
- What timeout policies are in place for different services and external dependencies?  
- How are timeouts tuned to balance system performance and failure detection?  
- Are **exponential backoff** and **jitter** applied to avoid overwhelming systems during retries?  
- How do you prevent "retry storms" (multiple systems retrying simultaneously, worsening load)?  

---

### **9. External Dependency Failures**
- How does the system handle failures in third-party services or APIs?  
- Is there a fallback mechanism or **graceful degradation** strategy if an external dependency fails?  
- What happens when an external service becomes available again?  
- Is there a retry policy specifically for third-party APIs?  

---

### **10. Recovery and Resilience**
- How does the system recover from failures once the root cause is resolved?  
- Is there an automated recovery mechanism or manual intervention required?  
- How quickly can the system recover from different types of failures (MTTR - Mean Time to Recovery)?  
- Does the system use **self-healing mechanisms** to automatically restart failed services?  
- How are retries coordinated with recovery mechanisms to avoid duplication?  

---

### **11. Load and Capacity Management During Failures**
- How does the system handle spikes in load caused by retries?  
- Are there mechanisms to **throttle** retries to avoid overwhelming the system?  
- How does the system ensure retries don't consume excessive resources?  
- Are failures or retries prioritized differently (e.g., critical requests first)?  

---

### **12. Testing and Validation**
- How is failure and retry handling tested (e.g., chaos engineering, fault injection)?  
- What tools or frameworks are used to simulate failures in the system?  
- Are scenarios like **network latency**, **server crashes**, and **database unavailability** tested?  
- How does the system ensure reliability under failure scenarios in production?

### **Examples of Specific Design Questions**
1. If a database transaction fails mid-way, how does the system ensure it doesn't cause inconsistencies?  
2. What happens when a message is lost in an event-driven system? How is it retried or replayed?  
3. How does the system handle retries in distributed systems where services are geographically separated?  
4. How does the retry logic interact with the downstream system's rate-limiting policies?  
5. How does the system recover from a network partition or temporary disconnection?

By asking these **failure and retry-related questions**, you can ensure the system is designed to be **resilient**, **fault-tolerant**, and capable of maintaining performance under failure scenarios. These aspects are crucial for building reliable, scalable, and production-ready systems.
