In Java, a **preview feature** is a new language or JVM feature that is **fully specified and implemented**, but **not yet permanent**. It‚Äôs included in a JDK release to gather feedback from developers before finalizing it in a future release.

---

### üîç **Key Characteristics of Preview Features**

- **Opt-in**: You must explicitly enable them using compiler and runtime flags.
- **Stable but not final**: They are tested and usable, but may change or be removed in future versions.
- **Feedback-driven**: Oracle uses developer feedback to refine or finalize the feature.

---

### ‚úÖ **How to Use Preview Features**

To **compile** and **run** Java code using preview features:

```bash
javac --enable-preview --release <version> MyClass.java
java --enable-preview MyClass
```

For example, with Java 25:

```bash
javac --enable-preview --release 25 Tier.java
java --enable-preview Tier
```

---

### üß™ Examples of Preview Features in Recent Java Versions

- **Pattern Matching for `switch`** (JEP 406)
- **Record Patterns** (JEP 405)
- **String Templates** (JEP 430)
- **Primitive Types in Patterns** (JEP 507)

To approach performance tuning for a **legacy Spring Boot service** that takes **20 seconds to respond under load**, here‚Äôs a structured and practical strategy:

---

## üîç Step-by-Step Performance Tuning Approach

### 1. **Understand the Baseline**
- Measure current performance using tools like:
  - **Spring Boot Actuator**
  - **Prometheus + Grafana**
  - **New Relic / Datadog / AppDynamics**
- Identify:
  - Which endpoints are slow?
  - What kind of load causes the delay?
  - Is it CPU-bound, memory-bound, or I/O-bound?

---

### 2. **Profile the Application**
Use profiling tools to find bottlenecks:
- **JProfiler**, **VisualVM**, or **YourKit**
- Look for:
  - Long-running methods
  - High GC activity
  - Thread contention
  - Database query latency

---

### 3. **Check Database Performance**
- Use **Spring Boot DevTools** or **Hibernate Statistics** to log SQL queries.
- Look for:
  - N+1 query problems
  - Missing indexes
  - Slow joins or subqueries
- Consider:
  - Connection pool tuning (e.g., HikariCP settings)
  - Caching frequently accessed data

---

### 4. **Analyze Threading and Concurrency**
- Check if the service is blocking (e.g., waiting on I/O).
- Use **asynchronous processing** (`@Async`, `CompletableFuture`) where possible.
- Tune thread pools:
  ```yaml
  spring.task.execution.pool.core-size: 10
  spring.task.execution.pool.max-size: 50
  ```

---

### 5. **Optimize Memory Usage**
- Check heap size and GC logs.
- Use JVM options:
  ```bash
  -Xms512m -Xmx2048m -XX:+UseG1GC
  ```
- Avoid loading large objects into memory unnecessarily.

---

### 6. **Enable Caching**
- Use Spring‚Äôs caching abstraction:
  ```java
  @Cacheable("users")
  public User getUserById(Long id) { ... }
  ```
- Backed by Redis, Caffeine, or Ehcache.

---

### 7. **Use Connection Pooling**
- Ensure efficient DB connections via **HikariCP** (default in Spring Boot).
- Tune pool size:
  ```yaml
  spring.datasource.hikari.maximum-pool-size=20
  ```

---

### 8. **Tune Web Server Settings**
- If using embedded Tomcat:
  ```yaml
  server.tomcat.max-threads=200
  server.tomcat.accept-count=100
  ```

---

### 9. **Use Load Testing Tools**
- Simulate load using:
  - **Apache JMeter**
  - **Gatling**
  - **Locust**
- Identify how performance degrades with increasing users.

---

### 10. **Consider Architectural Improvements**
- Introduce **circuit breakers** (e.g., Resilience4j)
- Use **rate limiting** and **bulkheads**
- Break monolith into microservices if needed

Improving query response time in a Spring Boot application using **native queries** (i.e., raw SQL via `@Query` or `EntityManager`) involves a combination of **database optimization**, **query tuning**, and **application-level improvements**.

Here are some effective strategies:

---

### üîç 1. **Optimize the Native SQL Query**
- **Use indexes**: Ensure that columns used in `WHERE`, `JOIN`, `ORDER BY`, and `GROUP BY` clauses are indexed.
- **Avoid SELECT ***: Only fetch the columns you need.
- **Limit result set**: Use `LIMIT` or pagination to reduce the amount of data returned.
- **Avoid unnecessary joins**: Simplify joins or use subqueries if they perform better.
- **Use query profiling tools**: Use `EXPLAIN` or `ANALYZE` to understand query execution plans.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 2. **Tune Spring Boot Configuration**
- **Connection Pooling**: Use a high-performance pool like **HikariCP** (default in Spring Boot).
  ```properties
  spring.datasource.hikari.maximum-pool-size=20
  spring.datasource.hikari.connection-timeout=30000
  ```
- **Enable query caching** (if applicable): Use Hibernate's second-level cache or database-level caching.

---

### üß† 3. **Use Projections or DTOs**
Instead of returning full entities, use **interface-based projections** or **DTOs** to fetch only required fields:
```java
@Query(value = "SELECT name, age FROM users WHERE age > :age", nativeQuery = true)
List<UserDTO> findUsersByAge(@Param("age") int age);
```

---

### üß™ 4. **Batch Processing and Streaming**
- For large datasets, use **streaming** to avoid loading everything into memory:
  ```java
  @Query(value = "SELECT * FROM large_table", nativeQuery = true)
  Stream<LargeEntity> streamAll();
  ```
- Use **batch inserts/updates** for bulk operations.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è 5. **Database-Level Improvements**
- **Partitioning**: Split large tables into smaller partitions.
- **Materialized views**: Precompute and store complex query results.
- **Stored procedures**: Offload complex logic to the database.

---

### üìà 6. **Monitoring and Profiling**
Use tools like:
- **Spring Boot Actuator**
- **New Relic**, **Datadog**, or **Prometheus + Grafana**
- **Database logs and slow query logs**

---

Here‚Äôs a curated list of **advanced practical questions related to concurrency in Java**, ideal for interviews or deep learning:

---

### üîÅ **Advanced Concurrency Questions in Java**

#### 1. **Thread Safety in Collections**
**Q:** How would you make a non-thread-safe collection like `ArrayList` thread-safe? What are the trade-offs between using `Collections.synchronizedList()` vs `CopyOnWriteArrayList`?

#### 2. **Deadlock Detection and Prevention**
**Q:** Write a Java program that simulates a deadlock scenario. Then, modify it to prevent deadlock using lock ordering or `tryLock()`.

#### 3. **Executor Framework**
**Q:** Design a task scheduler using `ScheduledExecutorService` that runs periodic tasks and handles exceptions gracefully.

#### 4. **Producer-Consumer Problem**
**Q:** Implement a thread-safe producer-consumer system using `BlockingQueue`. How would you handle backpressure?

#### 5. **Custom Thread Pool**
**Q:** Create a custom thread pool using `ThreadPoolExecutor`. How would you tune its parameters for high throughput and low latency?

#### 6. **Atomic Variables vs Synchronization**
**Q:** Compare `AtomicInteger` with `synchronized` blocks for incrementing a shared counter. Which is better and why?

#### 7. **CompletableFuture**
**Q:** Use `CompletableFuture` to run multiple asynchronous tasks and combine their results. How would you handle exceptions in the pipeline?

#### 8. **Fork/Join Framework**
**Q:** Implement a parallel sum of a large array using the `ForkJoinPool`. How does it differ from traditional thread pools?

#### 9. **ThreadLocal Usage**
**Q:** Demonstrate a use case for `ThreadLocal` in a multi-threaded web application. What are the risks of memory leaks?

#### 10. **Concurrency with Streams**
**Q:** How can you parallelize stream operations in Java? What are the caveats of using `parallelStream()`?
