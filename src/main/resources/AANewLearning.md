Improving query response time in a Spring Boot application using **native queries** (i.e., raw SQL via `@Query` or `EntityManager`) involves a combination of **database optimization**, **query tuning**, and **application-level improvements**.

Here are some effective strategies:

---

### üîç 1. **Optimize the Native SQL Query**
- **Use indexes**: Ensure that columns used in `WHERE`, `JOIN`, `ORDER BY`, and `GROUP BY` clauses are indexed.
- **Avoid SELECT ***: Only fetch the columns you need.
- **Limit result set**: Use `LIMIT` or pagination to reduce the amount of data returned.
- **Avoid unnecessary joins**: Simplify joins or use subqueries if they perform better.
- **Use query profiling tools**: Use `EXPLAIN` or `ANALYZE` to understand query execution plans.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 2. **Tune Spring Boot Configuration**
- **Connection Pooling**: Use a high-performance pool like **HikariCP** (default in Spring Boot).
  ```properties
  spring.datasource.hikari.maximum-pool-size=20
  spring.datasource.hikari.connection-timeout=30000
  ```
- **Enable query caching** (if applicable): Use Hibernate's second-level cache or database-level caching.

---

### üß† 3. **Use Projections or DTOs**
Instead of returning full entities, use **interface-based projections** or **DTOs** to fetch only required fields:
```java
@Query(value = "SELECT name, age FROM users WHERE age > :age", nativeQuery = true)
List<UserDTO> findUsersByAge(@Param("age") int age);
```

---

### üß™ 4. **Batch Processing and Streaming**
- For large datasets, use **streaming** to avoid loading everything into memory:
  ```java
  @Query(value = "SELECT * FROM large_table", nativeQuery = true)
  Stream<LargeEntity> streamAll();
  ```
- Use **batch inserts/updates** for bulk operations.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è 5. **Database-Level Improvements**
- **Partitioning**: Split large tables into smaller partitions.
- **Materialized views**: Precompute and store complex query results.
- **Stored procedures**: Offload complex logic to the database.

---

### üìà 6. **Monitoring and Profiling**
Use tools like:
- **Spring Boot Actuator**
- **New Relic**, **Datadog**, or **Prometheus + Grafana**
- **Database logs and slow query logs**

Here‚Äôs a curated list of **advanced practical questions related to concurrency in Java**, ideal for interviews or deep learning:

### üîÅ **Advanced Concurrency Questions in Java**

#### 1. **Thread Safety in Collections**
**Q:** How would you make a non-thread-safe collection like `ArrayList` thread-safe? What are the trade-offs between using `Collections.synchronizedList()` vs `CopyOnWriteArrayList`?

#### 2. **Deadlock Detection and Prevention**
**Q:** Write a Java program that simulates a deadlock scenario. Then, modify it to prevent deadlock using lock ordering or `tryLock()`.

#### 3. **Executor Framework**
**Q:** Design a task scheduler using `ScheduledExecutorService` that runs periodic tasks and handles exceptions gracefully.

#### 4. **Producer-Consumer Problem**
**Q:** Implement a thread-safe producer-consumer system using `BlockingQueue`. How would you handle backpressure?

#### 5. **Custom Thread Pool**
**Q:** Create a custom thread pool using `ThreadPoolExecutor`. How would you tune its parameters for high throughput and low latency?

#### 6. **Atomic Variables vs Synchronization**
**Q:** Compare `AtomicInteger` with `synchronized` blocks for incrementing a shared counter. Which is better and why?

#### 7. **CompletableFuture**
**Q:** Use `CompletableFuture` to run multiple asynchronous tasks and combine their results. How would you handle exceptions in the pipeline?

#### 8. **Fork/Join Framework**
**Q:** Implement a parallel sum of a large array using the `ForkJoinPool`. How does it differ from traditional thread pools?

#### 9. **ThreadLocal Usage**
**Q:** Demonstrate a use case for `ThreadLocal` in a multi-threaded web application. What are the risks of memory leaks?

#### 10. **Concurrency with Streams**
**Q:** How can you parallelize stream operations in Java? What are the caveats of using `parallelStream()`?
