---

### 6. **Explain the difference between Security Groups and Network ACLs in AWS.**
   **Answer**:
   - **Security Groups**: Act as virtual firewalls for EC2 instances, controlling inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level. They are stateful, meaning responses to allowed inbound traffic are automatically allowed outbound.
   - **Network ACLs**: Act as firewalls for subnets within a VPC, controlling inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level. They are stateless, meaning both inbound and outbound rules must be explicitly defined.

---

### 7. **What is AWS VPC, and why is it important?**
   **Answer**: Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) enables users to provision logically isolated sections of the AWS cloud where they can launch AWS resources in a virtual network they define. 
   - **Importance**:
     - Allows for IP addressing, subnet creation, routing configuration, and control over network traffic.
     - Enables secure, scalable, and flexible networking setups, including VPN or Direct Connect for private connectivity to on-premises resources.

---

### 8. **What are IAM Roles, and how are they used?**
   **Answer**: IAM (Identity and Access Management) Roles are identities with permission policies that determine what actions the role can take in AWS. They are not linked to a specific user and are typically used to grant temporary access to resources.
   - **Use Cases**:
     - Granting EC2 instances permissions to access other AWS resources, like S3 or DynamoDB.
     - Allowing users from another AWS account to access resources in your account.
     - Delegating access to applications running on AWS services.

---

### 9. **Explain Amazon RDS and its benefits.**
   **Answer**: Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) is a managed database service that supports several database engines (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, MariaDB, and Amazon Aurora).
   - **Benefits**:
     - Simplified database management with automated backups, patching, and monitoring.
     - Scalability through read replicas and multi-AZ deployments for high availability.
     - Enhanced security with encryption, IAM authentication, and network isolation with VPC.

---

### 10. **What are Amazon EBS volumes, and how are they different from instance store volumes?**
   **Answer**:
   - **Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)**: Persistent block storage attached to EC2 instances, surviving instance stop/start cycles and providing data durability.
   - **Instance Store**: Temporary block storage physically attached to the host where the EC2 instance is running. Data is lost if the instance is stopped or terminated.
   - **Difference**: EBS is persistent, while Instance Store is ephemeral and primarily used for temporary data.

---

### 11. **What is an Auto Scaling Group (ASG), and how does it work?**
   **Answer**: An Auto Scaling Group (ASG) is a collection of EC2 instances managed collectively to scale automatically based on demand. It can automatically increase or decrease the number of instances as per scaling policies.
   - **How it works**:
     - ASG defines minimum, maximum, and desired instance counts.
     - Scaling policies determine when to add or remove instances based on CloudWatch metrics like CPU utilization or request count.

---

### 12. **What are AWS CloudFormation and its benefits?**
   **Answer**: AWS CloudFormation is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) service that allows you to define and provision AWS infrastructure using templates.
   - **Benefits**:
     - Enables consistent and repeatable deployment of infrastructure.
