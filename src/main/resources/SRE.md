   - Define and measure Service Level Indicators (SLIs), such as latency, error rate, and availability.

2. **Monitoring and Incident Management:**
   - Design and implement monitoring, alerting, and observability systems for proactive issue detection.
   - Act as the primary point of contact during production incidents and outages.
   - Perform root cause analysis (RCA) and implement post-mortem improvements.

3. **Automation:**
   - Automate repetitive operational tasks (e.g., deployments, scaling, and incident resolution) to reduce toil.
   - Build self-healing systems that can recover from failures without manual intervention.

4. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Analyze system performance and implement optimizations to handle increased load and traffic.
   - Conduct capacity planning to ensure systems can scale as demand grows.

5. **Collaboration with Teams:**
   - Work closely with development teams to design systems that are robust and operationally efficient.
   - Provide feedback on application architecture and advocate for reliability best practices.
   - Collaborate with DevOps teams to streamline CI/CD pipelines and deployment processes.

6. **Incident Prevention:**
   - Conduct chaos engineering experiments to identify weaknesses in systems.
   - Implement practices like load testing and canary deployments to minimize risks.

7. **System Design and Architecture:**
   - Design and review distributed systems to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
   - Advocate for redundancy and disaster recovery strategies to handle unexpected failures.

8. **Error Budget Management:**
   - Balance innovation and reliability by defining error budgets.
   - Work with teams to prioritize reliability improvements versus new feature delivery.

### **Goals of an SRE**
1. Ensure systems meet **availability** and **performance** standards.
2. Minimize **manual toil** by leveraging automation.
3. Facilitate smooth **deployments** while maintaining system stability.
4. Reduce the **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)** during incidents.
5. Collaborate with development teams to build **resilient systems**.
