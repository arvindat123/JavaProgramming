#### In AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service), a cluster is a logical grouping of tasks or services. It acts as a container for managing and running ECS tasks and services. Clusters can include one or more container instances (EC2 instances) or use AWS Fargate for serverless container management.
### Key Points:
- Container Instances: If using EC2 launch type, the cluster groups the EC2 instances where containers run.
- Fargate: If using Fargate launch type, the cluster manages tasks without requiring EC2 instances.
- Task Scheduling: ECS schedules tasks on the cluster based on resource availability and task definitions.
- Isolation: Clusters can be used to isolate workloads, such as separating environments (e.g., staging, production).
