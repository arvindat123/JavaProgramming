Apollo is a popular ecosystem of tools and libraries for building, managing, and consuming GraphQL APIs. It provides solutions for both the server and client sides of GraphQL applications.

### Key Components:
1. **Apollo Server**: A GraphQL server implementation that allows you to define your schema, resolvers, and data sources. It integrates easily with various frameworks like Express, Koa, and more.

2. **Apollo Client**: A state management library for interacting with GraphQL APIs on the client side. It simplifies querying, caching, and managing application data.

3. **Apollo Studio**: A cloud-based platform for managing and monitoring GraphQL APIs, including schema versioning, performance tracking, and collaboration tools.

### Features:
- Schema stitching and federation for combining multiple GraphQL services.
- Built-in support for caching and real-time updates (subscriptions).
- Developer-friendly tools like Apollo DevTools for debugging.

Apollo is widely used for its flexibility, scalability, and ease of integration with modern web and mobile applications.

The selected line `policyTermUnit: PolicyTermUnit!` refers to the `PolicyTermUnit` enum, which is defined in the `enums.graphqls` file. This linkage is established because GraphQL schemas treat all `.graphqls` files in the same project as part of a unified schema. 

When the GraphQL schema is processed, all types, enums, inputs, and other definitions across `.graphqls` files are merged into a single schema. The `PolicyTermUnit` enum is resolved by its name, and since it is defined in `enums.graphqls`, the GraphQL engine automatically associates the reference in `policyTermUnit` with the corresponding enum definition. 

This behavior relies on the GraphQL schema loader or parser used in the project, which scans and combines all `.graphqls` files.
