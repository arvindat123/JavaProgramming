Apollo is a popular ecosystem of tools and libraries for building, managing, and consuming GraphQL APIs. It provides solutions for both the server and client sides of GraphQL applications.

### Key Components:
1. **Apollo Server**: A GraphQL server implementation that allows you to define your schema, resolvers, and data sources. It integrates easily with various frameworks like Express, Koa, and more.

2. **Apollo Client**: A state management library for interacting with GraphQL APIs on the client side. It simplifies querying, caching, and managing application data.

3. **Apollo Studio**: A cloud-based platform for managing and monitoring GraphQL APIs, including schema versioning, performance tracking, and collaboration tools.

### Features:
- Schema stitching and federation for combining multiple GraphQL services.
- Built-in support for caching and real-time updates (subscriptions).
- Developer-friendly tools like Apollo DevTools for debugging.

Apollo is widely used for its flexibility, scalability, and ease of integration with modern web and mobile applications.

The selected line `policyTermUnit: PolicyTermUnit!` refers to the `PolicyTermUnit` enum, which is defined in the `enums.graphqls` file. This linkage is established because GraphQL schemas treat all `.graphqls` files in the same project as part of a unified schema. 

When the GraphQL schema is processed, all types, enums, inputs, and other definitions across `.graphqls` files are merged into a single schema. The `PolicyTermUnit` enum is resolved by its name, and since it is defined in `enums.graphqls`, the GraphQL engine automatically associates the reference in `policyTermUnit` with the corresponding enum definition. 

This behavior relies on the GraphQL schema loader or parser used in the project, which scans and combines all `.graphqls` files.

In GraphQL, a **federated URL** typically refers to the URL of a service in a **federated GraphQL architecture**. Federation is a way to compose multiple GraphQL services into a single unified graph. Each service is responsible for a specific part of the schema, and the federated gateway combines these services into one API.

### Key Points:
1. **Federated Service**: A GraphQL service that defines part of the schema and resolves queries for its portion.
2. **Federated URL**: The endpoint (URL) where a federated service is hosted. The gateway uses this URL to route queries to the appropriate service.
3. **Apollo Federation**: A common implementation of GraphQL federation, where the gateway communicates with federated services using their URLs.

For example, in a federated setup:
- `http://users-service/graphql` handles user-related queries.
- `http://products-service/graphql` handles product-related queries.
- The gateway combines these into a single schema.

`@shareable` is a directive used in **Apollo Federation** to indicate that a type or field can be shared across multiple federated GraphQL services. It allows the same type to exist in multiple services without causing conflicts in the unified schema.

### Purpose:
In a federated GraphQL architecture, some types or fields may need to be defined in more than one service. The `@shareable` directive ensures that these overlapping definitions are allowed and treated as part of the same type in the combined schema.

### Example:
```graphql
type Account @shareable {
    accountId: String!
    accountName: String
}
```

Here, the `Account` type is marked as `@shareable`, meaning it can be defined in multiple services without causing schema conflicts.
