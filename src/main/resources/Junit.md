Testing private methods directly is generally not recommended because private methods are implementation details. Instead, you should test the public methods that use those private methods, ensuring the behavior is correct without needing to test private methods explicitly. However, there may be cases where you want to test private methods directly, such as for debugging or legacy code.

In JUnit 5, there are a few approaches to test private methods:

---

### **1. Use Reflection**
Reflection allows you to access and invoke private methods directly.

#### Example
```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

import java.lang.reflect.Method;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

class MyClass {
    private int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

public class MyClassTest {

    @Test
    void testPrivateMethod() throws Exception {
        MyClass myClass = new MyClass();

        // Access the private method using reflection
        Method method = MyClass.class.getDeclaredMethod("add", int.class, int.class);
        method.setAccessible(true);

        // Invoke the private method
        int result = (int) method.invoke(myClass, 5, 3);

        // Assert the result
        assertEquals(8, result);
    }
}
```

---

### **2. Use Public Wrapper Methods**
If a private method is complex, you can create a public or package-private method to wrap the private method and test it indirectly.

#### Example
```java
class MyClass {
    private int multiply(int a, int b) {
        return a * b;
    }

    // Public wrapper method for testing
    int testMultiply(int a, int b) {
        return multiply(a, b);
    }
}
```

You can then test the `testMultiply` method directly.

---

### **3. Use a Framework Like PowerMock (Not Recommended for JUnit 5)**
Frameworks like PowerMock allow testing private methods directly, but they are considered overkill and are often avoided in modern practices. With JUnit 5, it’s better to rely on reflection or test through public methods.

---

### **Best Practices**
1. **Focus on Public Behavior**: Instead of testing private methods, verify their behavior through public or package-private methods that call them.
2. **Refactor if Necessary**: If a private method is complex and needs direct testing, consider refactoring it into a separate class with public methods that you can test.
3. **Avoid Over-testing Implementation Details**: Testing private methods tightly couples your tests to the implementation, making it harder to refactor code.

Testing static methods in JUnit is straightforward because they can be invoked directly without creating an instance of the class. However, there are some nuances when it comes to mocking or dealing with dependencies in static methods.

---

### **1. Directly Test the Static Method**
If the static method has no dependencies and only performs computations or logic, you can directly invoke it in your test.

#### Example
```java
class MathUtils {
    public static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

public class MathUtilsTest {

    @Test
    void testAdd() {
        int result = MathUtils.add(5, 3);
        assertEquals(8, result);
    }
}
```

---

### **2. Mocking Static Methods**
If the static method interacts with external dependencies (e.g., databases, services), you may need to mock it. 

#### Using **Mockito with Mockito's MockedStatic** (Mockito 3.4+)
Mockito supports mocking static methods starting from version 3.4.

#### Example
```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.mockito.MockedStatic;
import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

class StringUtils {
    public static String toUpperCase(String input) {
        return input.toUpperCase();
    }
}

public class StringUtilsTest {

    @Test
    void testStaticMethodMocking() {
        try (MockedStatic<StringUtils> mockedStatic = mockStatic(StringUtils.class)) {
            // Define the mocked behavior
            mockedStatic.when(() -> StringUtils.toUpperCase("hello")).thenReturn("MOCKED");

            // Call the method and verify the mocked result
            assertEquals("MOCKED", StringUtils.toUpperCase("hello"));

            // Verify the interaction
            mockedStatic.verify(() -> StringUtils.toUpperCase("hello"), times(1));
        }
    }
}
```

---

### **3. Testing Static Methods with Dependencies**
If a static method interacts with external systems (e.g., a file system, a database), use **dependency injection** or refactor the static logic into a non-static method in a service class. This enables easier mocking and testing.

---

### **4. Avoid Over-using Static Methods**
Static methods can make unit testing harder, especially if they access or modify shared state. Use static methods only when:
- They are utility methods (e.g., `Math.max` or `StringUtils.toUpperCase`).
- They do not rely on mutable state.

If a static method becomes too complex or involves dependencies, consider refactoring it into an instance method in a dedicated class to facilitate testing.

---

### Best Practices
- Use **direct testing** for simple, pure static methods.
- Use **Mockito's `MockedStatic`** to mock static methods with dependencies.
- Refactor complex static methods into instance methods when possible to improve testability.
