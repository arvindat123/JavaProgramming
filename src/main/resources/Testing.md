Hereâ€™s a comprehensive list of **Angular interview questions and answers**, ranging from basic to advanced topics, suitable for freshers as well as experienced professionals:

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Basic Level (Beginner)**

#### 1. **What is Angular?**
Angular is a **TypeScript-based open-source front-end web application framework** developed by Google for building SPAs (Single Page Applications).

#### 2. **What are the key features of Angular?**
- Component-based architecture  
- Two-way data binding  
- Dependency Injection  
- Directives  
- Routing  
- RxJS for reactive programming  
- Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compilation

#### 3. **What is a component in Angular?**
A component is the **basic building block of Angular applications**. It consists of:
- `@Component` decorator
- HTML template
- CSS styles
- TypeScript class

#### 4. **What is a module in Angular?**
An Angular module (`NgModule`) is a **container for components, directives, pipes, and services**. Every Angular app has at least one module - the root module `AppModule`.

#### 5. **What is data binding?**
Data binding in Angular synchronizes **data between the model and view**. Types include:
- **Interpolation**: `{{ value }}`
- **Property binding**: `[property]="value"`
- **Event binding**: `(event)="handler"`
- **Two-way binding**: `[(ngModel)]="value"`

#### 6. **What is Angular CLI?**
Angular CLI is a command-line interface to create and manage Angular projects. Example:  
```bash
ng new app-name
ng generate component my-component
```

### ðŸ”¹ **Intermediate Level**

#### 7. **What is dependency injection in Angular?**
Itâ€™s a design pattern where Angular **automatically provides dependencies** (services, etc.) to a component or directive using constructors.

#### 8. **What is a service in Angular?**
A service is a class that **contains business logic or reusable code** and can be injected into components or other services.

#### 9. **What are directives in Angular?**
Directives are classes that **manipulate the DOM**:
- **Structural Directives**: `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`
- **Attribute Directives**: `ngClass`, `ngStyle`

#### 10. **What is RxJS?**
RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript) is a library for **reactive programming using Observables**. Angular uses it heavily for asynchronous operations (e.g., HTTP requests).

#### 11. **What is routing in Angular?**
Routing enables **navigation between different views** or components. Defined using `RouterModule` with route paths.

#### 12. **What are lifecycle hooks in Angular?**
Special methods called during the component lifecycle:
- `ngOnInit()`
- `ngOnChanges()`
- `ngDoCheck()`
- `ngAfterViewInit()`  
... and more.

### ðŸ”¹ **Advanced Level**

#### 13. **What is Change Detection?**
Change detection is the **mechanism that Angular uses to update the DOM** when data changes.

#### 14. **What is the difference between `ngOnInit()` and constructor()?**
- **Constructor**: Used for dependency injection.
- **ngOnInit()**: Called after constructor and component is initialized â€“ ideal for initializing data.

#### 15. **What is lazy loading in Angular?**
Lazy loading loads **modules only when required**, improving performance by splitting the app into smaller bundles.

#### 16. **What is the difference between reactive forms and template-driven forms?**
- **Template-driven**: Simple, declarative, uses `ngModel`
- **Reactive forms**: More complex, programmatic, uses `FormControl`, `FormGroup`

#### 17. **What are guards in Angular routing?**
Guards control access to routes. Types:
- `CanActivate`
- `CanDeactivate`
- `Resolve`
- `CanLoad`

#### 18. **What is Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation?**
AOT compiles HTML and TypeScript **into JavaScript during the build phase**, improving performance and early error detection.

#### 19. **What is the difference between `ViewChild` and `ContentChild`?**
- `@ViewChild` accesses template DOM elements.
- `@ContentChild` accesses content projected using `<ng-content>`.

#### 20. **How do you handle HTTP requests in Angular?**
Using `HttpClient` from `@angular/common/http` with Observables:
```ts
this.http.get('api/employees').subscribe(response => {...});
```

### ðŸ§  Bonus Tips:
- Learn common design patterns in Angular (singleton service, smart/dumb components).
- Know about **State Management** (NgRx, BehaviorSubject).
- Familiarize with **Unit Testing** and **e2e testing** using **Jasmine** and **Protractor** or **Cypress**.
