Here are detailed **.NET interview questions and answers** with examples, covering core concepts commonly asked in technical interviews:

---

### **1. What is the .NET Framework?**

**Answer:**
The .NET Framework is a software development platform developed by Microsoft. It provides a controlled environment for developing and running applications.

* **Components:**

  * **CLR (Common Language Runtime):** Manages memory, thread execution, garbage collection, and more.
  * **FCL (Framework Class Library):** Provides classes and APIs for common functions (IO, collections, security, etc.)

**Example:**

```csharp
using System;

class HelloWorld {
    static void Main() {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, .NET Framework!");
    }
}
```

### **2. What is the difference between .NET Framework, .NET Core, and .NET 5/6/7+?**

| Feature            | .NET Framework | .NET Core      | .NET 5+ (Unified Platform) |
| ------------------ | -------------- | -------------- | -------------------------- |
| Platform           | Windows only   | Cross-platform | Cross-platform             |
| Performance        | Lower          | Better         | Best                       |
| Open Source        | No             | Yes            | Yes                        |
| Latest Development | Stopped        | Active         | Actively evolving          |

---

### **3. What is the CLR (Common Language Runtime)?**

**Answer:**
CLR is the execution engine of the .NET framework. It provides:

* Memory management
* Garbage collection
* Exception handling
* Security
* Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation

**Example:**
When you compile a C# program, the compiler creates IL (Intermediate Language) code. CLR uses JIT to convert IL into native machine code.

### **4. What is the difference between Value Type and Reference Type?**

| Aspect    | Value Type               | Reference Type        |
| --------- | ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Stored in | Stack                    | Heap                  |
| Contains  | Actual data              | Reference to data     |
| Examples  | int, float, bool, struct | class, object, string |

**Example:**

```csharp
int a = 10;
int b = a;
b = 20;
Console.WriteLine(a); // Output: 10

class Person { public string Name; }
Person p1 = new Person(); p1.Name = "Alice";
Person p2 = p1; p2.Name = "Bob";
Console.WriteLine(p1.Name); // Output: Bob
```

---

### **5. What is a delegate in C#?**

**Answer:**
A delegate is a type-safe function pointer. It allows methods to be passed as parameters.

**Example:**

```csharp
delegate int MathOperation(int x, int y);

class Program {
    static int Add(int a, int b) => a + b;

    static void Main() {
        MathOperation op = Add;
        Console.WriteLine(op(3, 4)); // Output: 7
    }
}
```

---

### **6. What is Dependency Injection in .NET Core?**

**Answer:**
Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to implement IoC (Inversion of Control). It allows you to inject dependencies rather than creating them manually.

**Example:**

```csharp
public interface IMessageService {
    void SendMessage(string msg);
}

public class EmailService : IMessageService {
    public void SendMessage(string msg) {
        Console.WriteLine("Email sent: " + msg);
    }
}

public class HomeController {
    private readonly IMessageService _service;

    public HomeController(IMessageService service) {
        _service = service;
    }

    public void Notify() {
        _service.SendMessage("Hello from DI!");
    }
}
```

**In `Startup.cs`:**

```csharp
services.AddScoped<IMessageService, EmailService>();
```

---

### **7. What is the difference between `IEnumerable`, `IQueryable`, and `List<T>`?**

| Type        | Execution         | Use Case                           |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| IEnumerable | Deferred          | Iterating in-memory collections    |
| IQueryable  | Deferred (remote) | Querying databases (e.g., EF Core) |
| List<T>     | Immediate         | In-memory storage and manipulation |

**Example:**

```csharp
IEnumerable<int> nums = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3 }.Where(n => n > 1); // In-memory
IQueryable<int> qnums = dbContext.Users.Where(u => u.Age > 18); // EF Core
```

---

### **8. What is middleware in ASP.NET Core?**

**Answer:**
Middleware is software that's assembled into an app pipeline to handle requests and responses.

**Example:**

```csharp
public class CustomMiddleware {
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public CustomMiddleware(RequestDelegate next) {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task Invoke(HttpContext context) {
        Console.WriteLine("Before request");
        await _next(context);
        Console.WriteLine("After request");
    }
}

// In Startup.cs
app.UseMiddleware<CustomMiddleware>();
```

---

### **9. Explain async and await in C#**

**Answer:**
Used for asynchronous programming to avoid blocking the main thread.

**Example:**

```csharp
public async Task<string> GetDataAsync() {
    await Task.Delay(1000); // Simulate async operation
    return "Data received";
}
```

---

### **10. What is Boxing and Unboxing in C#?**

**Boxing**: Converting a value type to object.
**Unboxing**: Extracting the value type from the object.

**Example:**

```csharp
int num = 123;
object obj = num;         // Boxing
int i = (int)obj;         // Unboxing
```
