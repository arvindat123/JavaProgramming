Here are some common **REST API interview questions** and their answers that can help you prepare for an interview:

### 1. **What is REST?**
   **Answer:**
   REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on a stateless, client-server, cacheable communication protocol (usually HTTP) and uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to perform operations on resources, which are typically identified using URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers).

### 2. **What are the main HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs?**
   **Answer:**
   The most commonly used HTTP methods are:
   - **GET:** Retrieve data from the server.
   - **POST:** Send data to the server to create a resource.
   - **PUT:** Update an existing resource or create a new one if it doesn’t exist.
   - **PATCH:** Partially update an existing resource.
   - **DELETE:** Remove a resource from the server.

### 3. **What is the difference between PUT and POST?**
   **Answer:**
   - **PUT** is idempotent, meaning making multiple identical requests will produce the same result. It is generally used for updating an existing resource or creating it if it doesn't exist.
   - **POST** is not idempotent and is used to create a new resource. Each request can result in a new resource being created with a unique identifier.

### 4. **What is idempotency, and why is it important in RESTful services?**
   **Answer:**
   Idempotency means that making the same request multiple times will have the same effect as making it once. It’s important because it ensures the reliability of the API. HTTP methods like **GET**, **PUT**, and **DELETE** are idempotent, while **POST** is not.

### 5. **Explain the concept of statelessness in REST.**
   **Answer:**
   In REST, statelessness means that each request from the client to the server must contain all the necessary information for the server to understand and process the request. The server does not store any client state between requests. Each request is independent.

### 6. **What are the best practices for designing a REST API?**
   **Answer:**
   - Use meaningful and resource-based URIs (e.g., `/users/123`, not `/getUser`).
   - Use the correct HTTP methods for operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH).
   - Handle errors with proper HTTP status codes (e.g., 404 for not found, 500 for server errors).
   - Support filtering, sorting, and pagination for large datasets.
   - Use versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/users`) to maintain backward compatibility.
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., OAuth, JWT).

### 7. **What are HTTP status codes? Give some examples.**
   **Answer:**
   HTTP status codes are standard response codes used by web servers to indicate the outcome of a client's request. Some common ones include:
   - **200 OK:** The request was successful.
   - **201 Created:** The request was successful, and a new resource was created.
   - **400 Bad Request:** The request could not be understood or was missing required parameters.
   - **401 Unauthorized:** Authentication failed or user does not have permission for the requested operation.
   - **404 Not Found:** The requested resource could not be found.
   - **500 Internal Server Error:** The server encountered an error and could not complete the request.

### 8. **What is the difference between SOAP and REST?**
   **Answer:**
   - **SOAP** (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in web services, typically using XML.
   - **REST** is an architectural style that uses simple HTTP methods and can handle multiple data formats (XML, JSON, etc.).
   - REST is generally considered simpler and more flexible, while SOAP offers more robust security and transactional support.

### 9. **What is HATEOAS?**
   **Answer:**
   HATEOAS (Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State) is a constraint of REST that states a client interacts with a RESTful service entirely through the hypermedia provided dynamically by application servers. For example, when a client requests a resource, the response might contain links to related actions, like updating or deleting the resource.

### 10. **What is a resource in REST?**
   **Answer:**
   A resource in REST refers to an object or representation of something, which can be identified by a URI. Resources are the targets of the operations carried out via the HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

### 11. **What is CORS and why is it important?**
   **Answer:**
   CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the resource originated. It is important for security reasons to prevent unauthorized cross-origin HTTP requests.

### 12. **What are query parameters and path parameters in RESTful services?**
   **Answer:**
   - **Path Parameters**: These are part of the URL and used to identify specific resources (e.g., `/users/{id}` where `{id}` is a path parameter).
   - **Query Parameters**: These are used to filter or modify the resource response and are typically appended to the URL (e.g., `/users?sort=desc&limit=10`).

### 13. **How do you handle errors in REST APIs?**
   **Answer:**
   Errors in REST APIs should be handled by returning appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages. Common strategies include:
   - Use standardized error codes (e.g., 400 for bad request, 404 for not found, 500 for server error).
   - Include a descriptive error message in the response body.
   - Provide clear documentation for error responses so that clients can easily understand and act on them.

### 14. **What is rate limiting in REST APIs?**
   **Answer:**
   Rate limiting is a technique used to control the amount of incoming or outgoing traffic to or from a network. In REST APIs, rate limiting is applied to limit the number of requests a client can make in a given time period. It is important to prevent abuse and ensure the API’s performance and availability.

### 15. **How do you secure a REST API?**
   **Answer:**
   Some common methods to secure a REST API include:
   - **Authentication and Authorization**: Use OAuth, JWT, or API keys.
   - **HTTPS**: Encrypt communication using SSL/TLS to protect data in transit.
   - **Input Validation**: Validate input to prevent attacks like SQL injection or XSS.
   - **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
   - **CORS**: Ensure proper Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies.
   - **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest.

### 16. **What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous API calls?**
   **Answer:**
   - **Synchronous API calls** block the client until the server responds, meaning the client waits for the operation to complete.
   - **Asynchronous API calls** allow the client to continue executing other tasks without waiting for the server’s response. Callbacks or polling mechanisms are used to handle the response when it's ready.

### 17. **What is pagination in REST API?**
   **Answer:**
   Pagination refers to breaking down a large set of data into smaller chunks (pages) to limit the data returned by the server in a single request. REST APIs typically use query parameters like `page` and `limit` to implement pagination (e.g., `/users?page=2&limit=50`).

Here are some advanced Java multithreading interview questions and answers, typically asked for experienced professionals:

### 1. **What is the difference between `Thread` class and `Runnable` interface?**
   - **Answer**: 
     - `Thread` class: If a class extends `Thread`, it cannot extend any other class, as Java doesn’t support multiple inheritance. 
     - `Runnable` interface: Implementing `Runnable` allows the class to extend another class if required. Using `Runnable` is a more flexible way of achieving multithreading.
     - From a best practice perspective, implementing `Runnable` is preferred because it separates the task from the actual execution mechanism.

### 2. **What is the difference between `synchronized` block and `synchronized` method?**
   - **Answer**:
     - **Synchronized method**: Locks the entire method; when one thread is executing a synchronized method, the other thread has to wait.
     - **Synchronized block**: Allows you to lock only a section of the method, allowing other parts of the method to execute simultaneously, which improves performance when there is less contention.

### 3. **What are different states of a thread in Java?**
   - **Answer**: A thread in Java can be in one of the following states:
     1. **New**: Thread is created but not yet started.
     2. **Runnable**: After calling `start()`, the thread is ready for execution and can run when CPU time is available.
     3. **Blocked/Waiting**: Thread is waiting for a resource (like I/O) or another thread to finish execution.
     4. **Timed Waiting**: Thread waits for a specified amount of time.
     5. **Terminated**: The thread has finished execution.

### 4. **What is thread-safety, and how do you ensure it?**
   - **Answer**: 
     Thread-safety means ensuring that shared data is accessed and modified in a controlled manner, to avoid race conditions and inconsistent states. You can achieve thread-safety by:
     1. Using `synchronized` blocks or methods.
     2. Using `Lock` objects from `java.util.concurrent.locks`.
     3. Using atomic classes like `AtomicInteger`, `AtomicBoolean`.
     4. Using concurrent collections like `ConcurrentHashMap`, `CopyOnWriteArrayList`.
     5. Avoiding shared mutability altogether by using immutable objects.

### 5. **What is the difference between `wait()` and `sleep()`?**
   - **Answer**: 
     - `wait()`: Releases the lock it holds on the object and waits for another thread to invoke `notify()` or `notifyAll()` on that object. It must be called within a synchronized block.
     - `sleep()`: Puts the thread to sleep for a specified amount of time without releasing any locks it holds. It doesn’t require the synchronized block and is a static method of `Thread` class.

### 6. **What is the difference between `notify()` and `notifyAll()`?**
   - **Answer**:
     - `notify()`: Wakes up a single thread that is waiting on the object's monitor. It is non-deterministic, meaning it’s unpredictable which waiting thread will be woken up.
     - `notifyAll()`: Wakes up all the threads that are waiting on the object's monitor, but only one will get the lock and proceed, while others continue waiting.

### 7. **What is a `volatile` keyword in Java?**
   - **Answer**: The `volatile` keyword ensures that the value of a variable is always read from main memory, not from a thread’s local cache. It guarantees visibility of changes to variables across threads but doesn’t ensure atomicity.

### 8. **What is the `ThreadLocal` class in Java?**
   - **Answer**: `ThreadLocal` provides a way to create variables that are local to the thread, meaning every thread accessing that variable has its own local instance. It's useful for avoiding synchronization and ensuring that each thread has its own instance of a resource.

   ```java
   private static ThreadLocal<Integer> threadLocalVar = ThreadLocal.withInitial(() -> 1);
   ```

### 9. **What is the `Lock` interface in Java's `concurrent` package? How is it different from `synchronized`?**
   - **Answer**:
     - The `Lock` interface provides more sophisticated thread synchronization mechanisms than the traditional `synchronized` block.
     - Differences:
       1. You can try to acquire a lock using `tryLock()`, avoiding thread blocking if the lock is not available.
       2. `Lock` can have timeouts with `tryLock(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)`.
       3. Locks can be released in different blocks, unlike `synchronized` blocks where lock release happens at the end of the block.
       4. `Lock` allows for more complex synchronization, like read/write locks (`ReentrantReadWriteLock`).

### 10. **What is `ForkJoinPool` in Java?**
   - **Answer**: `ForkJoinPool` is a special implementation of the `ExecutorService` for parallel processing, introduced in Java 7. It uses a work-stealing algorithm where idle threads steal work from busy threads to optimize resource utilization. It’s ideal for divide-and-conquer algorithms, where tasks are recursively split into smaller tasks.

### 11. **What is the difference between `Executor` and `ExecutorService` in Java?**
   - **Answer**:
     - **Executor**: A simple interface that can run a task provided by `Runnable`.
     - **ExecutorService**: A more sophisticated interface that allows managing the lifecycle of threads, task scheduling, and returning results via `Future`.

   Example of creating a thread pool using `ExecutorService`:
   ```java
   ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
   ```

### 12. **What is the difference between `CyclicBarrier` and `CountDownLatch`?**
   - **Answer**: 
     - **CountDownLatch**: A synchronization aid that allows one or more threads to wait until a set of operations being performed in other threads complete. The count cannot be reset after reaching zero.
     - **CyclicBarrier**: Another synchronization aid that allows a group of threads to all wait for each other to reach a common barrier point. It can be reused (hence "cyclic") once the threads have reached the barrier.

### 13. **What are atomic operations in Java? How do you ensure atomicity in multithreading?**
   - **Answer**: Atomic operations are operations that are completed in a single step without being interrupted. Java provides `Atomic` classes (like `AtomicInteger`, `AtomicBoolean`, etc.) in the `java.util.concurrent.atomic` package, which perform thread-safe operations like increment, compare-and-set, etc., without the need for synchronization.

### 14. **What is the `ReentrantLock` in Java?**
   - **Answer**: `ReentrantLock` is a lock provided by the `java.util.concurrent.locks` package, which allows the same thread to acquire the lock multiple times without causing a deadlock. It offers more flexibility than the `synchronized` keyword, as it allows tryLock, lockInterruptibly, and fair lock mechanisms.

### 15. **What is the difference between `ConcurrentHashMap` and `HashMap`?**
   - **Answer**:
     - **HashMap**: Not thread-safe. It can cause concurrency issues if used in a multithreaded environment.
     - **ConcurrentHashMap**: A thread-safe alternative to `HashMap` that allows concurrent reads and updates without blocking the entire map. It divides the map into segments, and only a segment is locked when an update is being performed.

### 16. **Explain `ThreadPoolExecutor` in Java.**
   - **Answer**: `ThreadPoolExecutor` is the most configurable class from the `ExecutorService` framework that allows creating custom thread pools. It controls core pool size, maximum pool size, thread keep-alive time, and task queueing strategies.

### 17. **What is a `Semaphore` in Java?**
   - **Answer**: A `Semaphore` is a synchronization tool used to control access to a shared resource by a fixed number of threads. It maintains a set of permits, and threads acquire permits before accessing the resource. When permits are exhausted, threads wait until a permit is released.

### 18. **How does the `CompletableFuture` class improve concurrency?**
   - **Answer**: `CompletableFuture` introduced in Java 8 allows chaining of asynchronous tasks without blocking the main thread. It provides a more fluent API for dealing with futures and supports combining multiple futures with methods like `thenApply`, `thenCompose`, `thenCombine`, and `exceptionally`.

### 19. **What is a `Deadlock`, and how can you avoid it in multithreading?**
   - **Answer**: Deadlock is a situation where two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource, and neither can proceed. 
     - To avoid deadlocks:
       1. Avoid nested locks.
       2. Use a timeout with lock attempts (e.g., `tryLock`).
       3. Follow a consistent lock ordering.
       4. Use `java.util.concurrent` utilities like `Lock` and `Semaphore`.

### 20. **What is `LiveLock` in Java?**
   - **Answer**: LiveLock is a situation where two or more threads continuously change their state in response to the state of other threads but are unable to make progress. The
